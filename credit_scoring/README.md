## Context
Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit.

Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted.
