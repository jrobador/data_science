# Multivariate Regression

This repository contains the results of my work at INRIA on the following topics:

- Understanding and implementation of the paper "Improving Individual-Specific Functional Parcellation Through Transfer Learning."
- Mathematical formulation of loss functions and definition of various neural network architectures based on the problem to be solved.
- Implementation of linear regression models: Ridge Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
- Implementation of nonlinear regression models: Various kernels with synthetic data.
- Enhancement of neural network training processes: Application of callbacks such as LR Scheduler, Early Stopping, experiment control with Tensorboard, and Best Model saver.
- Implementation of nonlinear regression models for features from the paper: MLP, Multimodal Embeddings, Resnet50 (custom implementation in PyTorch with skorch wrapper).
- Study and implementation of spherical harmonics.
- Application and understanding of metrics during training and testing: R2, MAPE, MSE, MAE. Latent space representation graph in MME.
- Use of SSH connection, GPU with CUDA, SLURM, and GIT.
